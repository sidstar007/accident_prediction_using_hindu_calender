<h1>Accident Prediction Using Hindu Calender</h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to explore the relationship between the Hindu calendar and accident occurrences to predict potential accident-prone days. By analyzing historical accident data in relation to the lunar phases, tithis, nakshatras, and other elements of the Hindu calendar, we aim to identify patterns that could help in forecasting accident likelihoods. This can aid in enhancing public safety measures and planning emergency response services.</p>
